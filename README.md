# Hi 👋 I'm Mohamed (Frontend Developer)

I'm a Frontend Developer who loves building interfaces that FEEL alive not just exist.  
Creativity + Animation + Pixel Control + UI Craft — this is where I live.

## About Me
- I believe frontend is ART not just markup.
- I love turning ideas → Interactive Experiences.
- Every project I do… لازم يكون ليه روح .. مش مجرد كود.
